# Problem Statement:
Question: How can I create a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using the MNIST dataset with a Neural Network in a Jupyter notebook?

# Brief about the Project:
Here's a short description of MNIST handwritten digit recognition using neural networks, incorporating images:  MNIST Dataset:  Meaning: Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology Contents: 70,000 handwritten digit images (28x28 pixels, grayscale) Digits: 0-9 Division: 60,000 for training, 10,000 for testing. 

# Accuracy:
Well-trained neural networks can achieve over 99% accuracy on MNIST.
